# Topic and Comment Editing Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Type Mismatch Issues
- **Fixed Comment topic_id type**: Changed from `number` to `string` in `types/index.ts` to match Topic ID type
- **Fixed file handling**: Improved nullable file ID handling in both creation and updates

### 2. Loading State Management
- **Fixed delete comment loading**: Changed from `setLoading(true)` to `setSubmitting(true)` to prevent UI conflicts
- **Improved error handling**: Added consistent error states and better cleanup in finally blocks

### 3. File Management Improvements
- **Enhanced file upload error handling**: Added try-catch blocks around file upload operations
- **Fixed file deletion**: Added proper error handling when removing files from storage
- **Added file removal for comments**: Users can now remove current attachments when editing comments
- **Improved file replacement**: Better handling of old file cleanup when replacing attachments

### 4. Database Operations
- **Enhanced topic creation**: Better error handling and validation for topic creation
- **Improved comment updates**: Fixed nullable file handling in comment updates
- **Added cascade delete**: Topic deletion now properly removes associated comments
- **Better error messages**: More descriptive error messages for users

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- **Added current file preview in editing**: Users can see and remove current attachments when editing
- **Improved comment header layout**: Better spacing and alignment for comment actions
- **Enhanced loading indicators**: Consistent loading states across all operations
- **Better success feedback**: Added success messages for file removals

## New Features Added

### Comment File Management
- Users can now remove current file attachments when editing comments
- Visual preview of current attachments during editing
- Replace functionality for comment attachments

### Enhanced Error Handling
- More descriptive error messages
- Better recovery from partial failures
- Improved user feedback for all operations

### Improved Deletion Flow
- Topics now properly delete associated comments
- File cleanup during deletions
- Better confirmation dialogs

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test topic editing with file replacement**
2. **Test comment editing with file operations**
3. **Test deletion flows (both topics and comments)**
4. **Test error scenarios** (network issues, permission problems)
5. **Test file upload failures** and recovery

## Code Quality Improvements

- Consistent error handling patterns
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved type safety
- Enhanced user feedback
- More robust file operations

All editing functionality should now work reliably with proper error handling and user feedback.
