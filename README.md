# SelfDB Expo Integration

This Expo React Native project has been successfully integrated with SelfDB SDK. Here's what has been set up:

## Features Implemented

### üîê Authentication
- **AuthContext**: Complete authentication provider with React Context
- **Login/Register Screens**: Native mobile forms with proper keyboard handling
- **Auth Modal**: Modal component for login/register flows
- **Persistent Auth**: Automatic auth state restoration on app restart

### üì± UI Components
- **TopicsList**: Display topics with pull-to-refresh
- **CreateTopic**: Form to create new topics with file upload support
- **TopicDetail**: View individual topics and comments
- **Auth Screens**: Native login and registration forms

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration
- **SelfDB Client**: Configured with environment variables
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read topics and comments
- **Real-time Support**: Ready for real-time updates

## Environment Setup

The `.env` file contains your SelfDB configuration:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SELFDB_URL=https://api.selfdb.io
EXPO_PUBLIC_SELFDB_STORAGE_URL=https://storage.selfdb.io
EXPO_PUBLIC_SELFDB_ANON_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Key Differences from Vite React

1. **Environment Variables**: Uses `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix instead of `VITE_`
2. **Navigation**: Uses Expo Router instead of React Router
3. **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet instead of CSS
4. **Components**: Native components (View, Text, TouchableOpacity) instead of HTML
5. **File Uploads**: Ready for React Native image picker integration

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** (already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. **Test the app**:
   - Open in Expo Go app on your phone
   - Or run on iOS/Android emulator

## Next Steps

To fully test the integration, you'll need to:

1. Set up your SelfDB backend with the proper tables:
   - `topics` table
   - `comments` table
   - User authentication

2. Update the `.env` file with your actual SelfDB credentials

3. Test the authentication flow and data operations

The codebase is now ready and follows React Native best practices while maintaining the same functionality as the original Vite React implementation.
